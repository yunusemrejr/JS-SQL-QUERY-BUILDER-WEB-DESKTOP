# JS-SQL-QUERY-BUILDER-WEB-DESKTOP
SQL Query Builder Web/Desktop Tool for my website.
This is one of the web tools I integrated into my personal blogger blog. 
Initially was planning on building a pure vanilla JavaScript set of query building tools.
Later on decided to switch it to a Java desktop application.
Download from the page --> choose your operating system --> run.
